MODEL: marker1_or_not
=======================
Binary Classification Model for Marker 1 Detection

Training Date: 2025-09-14
Model Type: Random Forest Classifier
Task: Binary classification (Marker 1 vs Not Marker 1)

CLASS MAPPING:
- Class 0: Not Marker 1 (includes marker = 0 AND marker = 2)
- Class 1: Marker 1 (marker = 1 only)

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Test Accuracy: 57.1%
- ROC AUC: 0.640
- Validation Accuracy: 61.3%

DATA DISTRIBUTION:
Original data (after marker propagation):
- Marker 0 (no touch): 27,597 samples
- Marker 1: 12,500 samples
- Marker 2: 5,250 samples

Window-level distribution:
- Marker 1 windows: 660 (45.7%)
- Not Marker 1 windows: 784 (54.3%)

DATA SPLIT:
- Training: 70%
- Validation: 15%
- Test: 15%
- Class Balancing: SMOTE

FEATURE CONFIGURATION:
- Sample Rate: 250 Hz
- Window Size: 250 samples (1 second)
- Overlap: 50% (125 samples)
- Channel Pairs: C3-C4, P3-P4, P7-P8, T7-T8
- Frequency Bands: Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz), Gamma (30-50 Hz)
- Total Features: 160

HYPERPARAMETERS (Best):
- n_estimators: 200
- max_depth: 20
- min_samples_split: 2
- min_samples_leaf: 1

MARKER PROPAGATION:
- Before window: 49 samples
- After window: 200 samples
- Total window: ~1 second of EEG response

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
The lower accuracy (57.1%) compared to the marker12_or_none model (69.6%) suggests that:
1. Distinguishing between Marker 1 and Marker 2 is more challenging than general touch detection
2. Marker 1 and Marker 2 may represent similar EEG patterns (both are touch events)
3. The model performs only slightly better than random chance (50%)

This indicates that the EEG signatures for different touch types (Marker 1 vs 2) may be very similar,
making discrimination difficult with current features.
