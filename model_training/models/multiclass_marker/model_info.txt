==========================
Multiclass Classification for Rubber Hand Illusion Detection

Training Date: 2025-09-14
Model Type: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with One-vs-Rest
Task: 3-class classification for rubber hand illusion EEG detection

CLASS MAPPING:
- Class 0: No Touch (no stimulation)
- Class 1: Both Hands (real + fake hand touched simultaneously)
- Class 2: Fake Hand Only (only fake hand touched)

NEUROSCIENCE CONTEXT:
This model is designed to detect the rubber hand illusion, a phenomenon where
synchronous touching of a real hand and a rubber hand can create a sense of
ownership over the fake hand. The three classes represent different experimental
conditions in the rubber hand illusion paradigm.

PERFORMANCE METRICS (TEST SET):
- Overall Accuracy: 47.9%
- Macro F1-Score: 0.469
- Weighted F1-Score: 0.48

PER-CLASS PERFORMANCE:
                Precision  Recall  F1-Score  Support
No Touch           0.51     0.47     0.49      76
Both Hands         0.55     0.47     0.51      99
Fake Hand Only     0.34     0.50     0.40      42

BEST MODEL HYPERPARAMETERS (SVM):
- C: 10
- Kernel: RBF
- Gamma: auto
- Decision Function: One-vs-Rest

COMPARISON WITH BINARY MODELS:
- marker12_or_none (binary): 69.6% accuracy
- marker1_or_not (binary): 57.1% accuracy
- multiclass_marker: 47.9% accuracy

The lower accuracy in multiclass compared to binary classification indicates:
1. The complexity of distinguishing between three distinct neural states
2. The similarity between "Both Hands" and "Fake Hand Only" neural signatures
3. The challenge of detecting subtle differences in somatosensory processing

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
1. The model performs best on "Both Hands" class (F1: 0.51)
2. "Fake Hand Only" is the most challenging class (F1: 0.40)
3. Confusion between "Both Hands" and "Fake Hand Only" is common
4. The model performs significantly better than random chance (33.3%)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1. Collect more data, especially for the minority "Fake Hand Only" class
2. Explore temporal features capturing the dynamics of touch response
3. Add cross-frequency coupling features
4. Consider hierarchical classification (first detect touch/no-touch, then classify touch type)
5. Investigate deep learning approaches (CNN-LSTM) for automatic feature learning
